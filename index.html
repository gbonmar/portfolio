          I've worked on a number of website development projects for more than 22 months in my previous company <a href="https://www.luxurypresence.com/">Luxury Presence</a>, including a significant switch from v2 to v3 platforms as my project.

          <br><br>
          I like badminton and traveling, especially the food of the newly explored place, so I have a lot of interests outside of the internet world. I spend my free time engaging in my interests or looking for ideas for my next project when I'm not completely involved in the world of web development.
          <br><br>
          My passion for web development starts when I was 15, back on the day we had a computer rental shop. One time a close neighbor of mine were developing his own project using HTML and CSS and I was totally amazed because of the idea that he, a college undergrade can make a website that is accessible by the browser. I had sat there watching him finish his time and waited for the final moment to ask how to create my own website too, he tutored me for an hour and that is how I find web development a fun career.
          <br><br>
          Being able to troubleshoot network problems and manage cables into a soothing-for-the-eye style for big companies was my dream job, however, the pandemic hit and made me pursue and hone my skills in web development. Still my dream but I love the idea of designing beautiful websites and applying another design technologies in the existing website.
          <br><br>
          Congenial person is what they describe in most of the places that I've been in especially in my workplace. I able to get along with lots of different kinds of people in anywhere I go and maybe because I've been in a great working envinronment that I'm able to adapt.

                      <p class="workText">The Senior Website Builder, my role in my previous company, encompasses a range of responsibilities aimed at ensuring the smooth and efficient operation of websites. I utilize my expertise to carefully edit website content, ensuring its accuracy, engagement, and optimization for search engines. Through skillful customization of layouts, graphics, and typography, I strive to create visually impressive and user-friendly websites that leave a lasting impact on visitors. The responsibilities are vast but not limited to:</p><br>

                      <ul class="workList">
                          <li class="workInfo">In addition I actively collaborate with Data Specialists, working closely with them to implement their tasks seamlessly. This collaborative effort allows us to integrate various data-driven features and functionalities into websites, such as dynamic content, personalized user experiences, and advanced analytics. By leveraging these data-driven insights, I contribute to enhancing the overall performance and effectiveness of the websites we build.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="workInfo">While I excel at implementing client requests with precision and attention to detail, I also embrace an innovative mindset. In my role as a Senior Website Builder, I constantly seek out opportunities to push the boundaries of creativity and functionality. Whether it's designing unique interactive elements, developing custom features, or exploring emerging technologies, I strive to bring fresh ideas to the table and deliver exceptional websites that exceed client expectations.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="workInfo">I understand the importance of maintaining productivity and ensuring efficient use of time during work hours. <strong>Time Doctor 2</strong> is a valuable tool that aids in monitoring and managing time effectively. By using Time Doctor 2, my team and I are able to track and analyze our work activities, enabling us to optimize our workflow and enhance overall productivity.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="workInfo">Effective communication and collaboration are vital components of my role. <strong>Slack</strong> is a powerful tool that my team and I utilize to facilitate seamless communication, streamline workflows, and enhance productivity throughout our projects. One of the key advantages of Slack is its ability to organize conversations into specific channels based on projects, teams, or topics. This structure helps to keep discussions focused and easily accessible, ensuring that relevant information is readily available to the right individuals. By utilizing dedicated channels for specific projects or departments, we can minimize confusion, enhance transparency, and ensure that everyone involved has access to the necessary information.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="workInfo">Project management plays a crucial role in successfully delivering high-quality websites. <strong>Asana</strong> is a powerful project management tool that my team and I utilize to plan, organize, and track our projects effectively. Asana provides a centralized platform where we can create and manage projects, assign tasks, set deadlines, and track progress. By utilizing Asana, we can establish clear project structures, define milestones, and allocate responsibilities to team members. This helps to ensure that everyone is aligned on project objectives, timelines, and deliverables right from the start. We used Asana when I started in Luxury Presence but we transfer to Salesforce afterward.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="workInfo"><strong>Salesforce</strong> serves as a powerful CRM platform that we utilize as Senior Website Builders to streamline our sales processes, manage customer interactions, and ensure client satisfaction. By leveraging Salesforce's features and capabilities, we can effectively manage client relationships, automate routine tasks, gain valuable insights, and deliver exceptional website solutions to our clients.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="workInfo">We rely on various <strong>Google tools</strong> to facilitate communication, collaboration, and organization. From conducting meetings with Google Meet, scheduling appointments with Google Calendar, sharing files through Google Drive, and leveraging other Google productivity tools, we ensure efficient teamwork and successful project outcomes. These tools allow us to streamline our processes, enhance productivity, and deliver high-quality websites to our clients.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="workInfo"><strong>Coda.io</strong> serves as a valuable tool for sharing thoughts, facilitating discussions, and voting on opinions during meetings as Senior Website Builders. By leveraging its collaborative features and interactive capabilities, we can ensure that meetings are productive, inclusive, and that decisions are made collectively. Coda.io helps us capture and organize meeting-related information, improving collaboration and ensuring that projects progress efficiently.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li class="workInfo">We used a <strong>platform similar to WordPress</strong>, it serves as a reliable and user-friendly CMS for building and managing websites. It offers customization options, plugin support, and a content management system that enables us to efficiently create and maintain high-quality websites for our clients. By leveraging this platform's features and capabilities, we can deliver websites that meet our clients' expectations while streamlining our website development process.</li>
